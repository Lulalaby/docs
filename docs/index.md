# Introduction

SinusBot is a MusicBot that will let you listen to music together with your friends on either TeamSpeak 3 or Discord. But it doesn't stop there - there's a lot of user-made scripts that can let SinusBot manage your Server and enhance the experience of your users in several ways.

You and your friends can control the bot either through the included web interface or via commands through TeamSpeak 3 or Discord.

## What you need

The SinusBot can run on either Windows or Linux, but only on the 64bit versions of those operating systems.

Most users usually want their bot to run 24/7 and thus will rent a Linux server on the internet and install it there. If you don't know how to handle a Linux server, you can also have your SinusBot managed by one of our [partners](https://www.sinusbot.com/#partners) for a little fee and just focus on the functionality.
