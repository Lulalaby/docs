Be sure that "TeamSpeak 3 Support" is checked.

If the option is not available then the installer could not find a compatible TeamSpeak Client (latest version 64-Bit).
If you continue installation without this checkbox enabled the SinusBot will only be able to connect to Discord.

## I can only connect the SinusBot to Discord, how can I fix it?

As mentioned above: "TeamSpeak 3 Support" needs to be enabled when installing the SinusBot. To fix this you need to:

1. Delete the SinusBot
2. Install a compatible (latest version 64-Bit) TeamSpeak Client
3. Reinstall the SinusBot as described above
