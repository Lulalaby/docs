1. Download and install the latest **64-Bit** [TeamSpeak 3 Client](https://teamspeak.com/en/downloads/) for Windows.

2. Download the [SinusBot](https://www.sinusbot.com/#download) for Windows and start it.

Be sure that "TeamSpeak 3 Support" is checked, as shown in the following picture:

If the option is not available then the installer could not find a compatible TeamSpeak Client (see step 1).
If you continue installation without this checkbox enabled the SinusBot will only be able to connect to Discord.

## I can only connect the SinusBot to Discord, how can I fix it?

As mentioned above: "TeamSpeak 3 Support" needs to be enabled when installing the SinusBot. To fix this you need to:

1. Delete the SinusBot
2. Uninstall old or otherwise uncompatible TeamSpeak Clients.
3. Install a compatible (latest version, 64-Bit) TeamSpeak Client
4. Reinstall the SinusBot as described above

If that's *still* not working then make sure to uninstall any old and 32-Bit TeamSpeak Clients and reinstall the latest 64-Bit TeamSpeak Client in the *default location*.
