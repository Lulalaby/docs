# Localize the SinusBot

Before you begin you may check the [resources](https://forum.sinusbot.com/resources/categories/language-files.10/) if there already exists a translation. \\
Is there an outdated translation and the author does not answer your request? Report the translation on the forums. 

Just follow these steps:

* Make sure you have a folder called data/locales within in your SinusBot directory
* Create a new file called ru.json (if you want to create a russian translation for example) with the following contents: `{"__name": "Russian", "__code": "ru-RU"}`
* Open up the webinterface of the bot and navigate to your personal settings
* Choose Russian as your language
* Then click on "edit" behind the language selection
* Fill all the textboxes next to the phrases you would like to translate
* Hit "Export" at the bottom of the page
* Copy the contents of the export box to your ru.json
* Done.

> **The translation interface will highlight untranslated content in yellow and phrases that have not been saved yet in violet.**

We're giving out extended licenses and access to pre-releases to everyone who contributes a lot or even maintains a translation. ;-)
